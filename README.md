# MenuFilter #

Chrome extension to highlight items on restaurant menus 
which fit the users dietary requirements. Starting off 
with vegetarian, may expand to vegan and other types of 
diets after.

Should save people time so that they don't have to scan 
through a menu for items they can eat.

Feel free to contribute ...
